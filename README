Database Systems Group 4

**General Information**

Applicable to all Groups and tasks:
As part of this course, each student is required to contribute to the development of a structured
database project, culminating in both a written term paper and an individual presentation (see
StuPo HA+RE guidelines). The project is divided into two phases, with initial submissions due
on November 28th (December 5th) and final submissions due on January 16th.

**General Requirements:**
The focus of this project is the creation and manipulation of database structures through SQL
or Python-based code. Students are expected to submit **well-documented code, with ample
comments and explanations to ensure clarity**. Alternatively, a traditional written report may be
provided. Each student must also prepare an individual presentation, discussing one aspect of
their schema or database development, to be delivered at the end of each phase. This
approach is intended to balance the workload evenly among participants

**Submission Requirements for Phase 1:**
Database Structure Creation: Submit an SQL script that initializes the database structure, including tables, relations, constraints, and views. This script should begin with a
USE **dbsysgr4**; statement to specify the database context. You may utilize tools such as MySQL Workbench to assist in the model development.
Sample Data Generation: Include an SQL script that populates the schema with sample data, which will be used to demonstrate and test the functionality of the database.
Functionality Testing: Provide SQL scripts that test the database's constraints and functionalities, ensuring that the schema operates as expected.
Individual Presentations: Each group member must prepare an individual presentation that covers a specific component of the schema. This will be followed by a Q&A
session to assess understanding and depth of knowledge.

The presentation should provide an **In-depth explanation of the design choices, challenges encountered, and any optimizations applied**.

**Development Environment:**
All tables, views, and procedures must be implemented within the group schema provided on the server at reddata.m.hs-offenburg.de. If additional test schemas are
needed, students may request them or utilize a local database installation.
